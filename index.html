          <p class="text-two">And can I request 1 thing? 
            Can u just forget what I confessed if u have rejected me.
            I'm afraid that it might be the end of our good acquaintance.
            I just hope that we can go back to the way before. 
            Or if I got "YES"(although I know that u'll reject me), I would be on top of the world. 
            As u're studying abroad, I know u only want to focus on your studies. 
            I'll try my best not to bother u. 
            1 reason why I confessed to u is that I just want to let u know and get this off my chest before u study abroad.
            And pls think abt how much courage it took to send u this
